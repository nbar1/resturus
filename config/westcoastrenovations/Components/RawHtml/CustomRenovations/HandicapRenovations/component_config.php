Your handi-cap accessible bathroom doesn\'t need to look institutional as they can be furnished with almost any luxury fixtures, tiles and finishes and still be totally ergonomically friendly.<br /><br />Today more and more seniors are wishing to remain in their homes for as long as possible to maintain their independence, with that goal we can design and construct a bathroom that works for seniors and is "user-friendly and safe from slip and falls," even if you are mobility-challenged. We regularly remove existing bathtubs and replace them with barrier-free showers with built-in seats/benches, grabbars/support bars and easily-accessible controls that are both beautiful and functional . Your bathroom can now be custom-built to your mobility needs both for the present and taking into consideration future mobility needs.',
